# Welcome to the GooglyEyes Chrome Extension

## Introduction
At GooglyEyes, our focus lies in improving the browsing experience for the elderly and dyslexic with our GooglyEyes 👀 chrome extension! 

Also, we work to invade the web with our hacky dark mode 🤓 and train our little GooglyEyes to read your news articles, bedtime stories, or lecture notes out aloud ✌️
Omai, we're basically building your very own storyteller.
